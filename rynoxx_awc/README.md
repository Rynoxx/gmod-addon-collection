## Admin Weapon Checker ##

Allows admins to remove, drop and confiscate weapons from players from the context menu.

Use the built-in console variable `awc_allowed_usergroup` to set which usergroup can access the menu.
E.g. `awc_allowed_usergroup "superadmin"` allows only superadmins (and on ULX any group that inherits from it)
